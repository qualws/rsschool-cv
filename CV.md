* For a long time I did not know what exactly I want to do. But now Iâ€™m sure that I want to move towards the Front-End, improve and apply the acquired knowledge and skills in practice in interesting projects. 

* Basic knowledge HTML and CSS, elementary knowledge JS.

* Code examples ```javascript 
function basicOp(operation, value1, value2)
{
  switch (operation) {
  case '+': return value1 + value2;
  break;
  case '-': return value1 - value2;
  break;
  case '*': return value1 * value2;
  break;
  case '/': return value1 / value2;
  break;
  default: alert('Error');
  }
}
```

* No development experience
