# Junior Developer Resume
* Maxim Liapeyey

* Phone: +375255255490, Social [VK] (https://vk.com/id309332283)

* For a long time I did not know what exactly I want to do. But now Iâ€™m sure that I want to move towards the Front-End, improve and apply the acquired knowledge and skills in practice in interesting projects. 

* Basic knowledge HTML and CSS, elementary knowledge JS.

* Code examples 

```javascript 
function basicOp(operation, value1, value2)
{
  switch (operation) {
  case '+': return value1 + value2;
  break;
  case '-': return value1 - value2;
  break;
  case '*': return value1 * value2;
  break;
  case '/': return value1 / value2;
  break;
  default: alert('Error');
  }
}
```

* No development experience 

* I study at the BSU at the Faculty of Philosophy and Social Sciences. My specialty is philosophy. Interestingly, logic, part of philosophy, is the basis of programming. Perhaps, understanding the logic of the language, you can not experience significant difficulties in its development. Also taking HTML, CSS, and JS courses on Codeacademy.

* My English is at the level of understanding the text. Spoken is very bad because there was no practice.
